# Mini Test Suite for Skatteverket's Test Personal Number API
Note about [the API](https://www7.skatteverket.se/portal/apier-och-oppna-data/utvecklarportalen/oppetdata/Test%C2%AD%C2%ADpersonnummer):
It provides test personal numbers for developers; 1 test personal number per date of birth (from 1890 until 2025).

## Requirements
- JDK 17

## Setup
Run this Maven Wrapper script. It downloads and runs Maven version 3.9.9, and runs all tests.
```bash
mvnw test      # Unix/macOS (untested)
mvnw.cmd test  # Windows
```

## Assumptions


### Assumptions about API Usage
The chosen tests were based on assumptions of the API Usage.

TODO later: continue here, when I say.




## Implemented Tests + What They Verify
- TODO later, when I say.
